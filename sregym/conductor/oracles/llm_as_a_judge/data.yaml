  answer: "The container images for the 'frontend' and 'geo' services are missing the specified executable files ('frontend' and 'geo' respectively) in their $PATH, leading to RunContainerError and preventing the pods from starting successfully. This is likely a misconfiguration in the Dockerfile or build process of the application images."

  answer: "The MongoDB deployments (mongodb-geo, mongodb-profile, mongodb-rate, and mongodb-recommendation) are configured with the '--auth' argument, enabling authentication. However, there is no indication of corresponding user creation or proper authentication mechanisms in place for the clients connecting to these MongoDB instances. This leads to authentication failures, causing the MongoDB processes to terminate and the pods to enter an 'Error' state and restart repeatedly, making the deployments unavailable."
  oracle: "False"
- description: "The 'product-catalog' deployment is mis-configured to pull the non-existent image 'app-image:latest'."
  answer: "The 'product-catalog' deployment is failing to pull its container image 'app-image:latest' due to 'pull access denied'. This indicates that the image either does not exist or there are authentication issues preventing the pod from accessing it."
  oracle: "True"

  answer: "No faults were detected in the application. All pods and deployments are running as expected, and the service dependency graph shows no anomalies. The 'checkout' pod's termination was part of a normal rolling update, and its logs show no errors."
  oracle: "FalseNegative"
- description: "The 'geo' deployment is configured to use a buggy container image 'yinfangchen/geo:app3', this causes the pod keep restarting and entering the 'Error' state."
  answer: "Multiple services (profile, rate, recommendation, reservation, user) are experiencing repeated restarts. The 'profile' pod's description indicates that its container terminated with an 'Error' and Exit Code 2. This suggests an application-level crash within the shared 'yinfangchen/hotelreservation:latest' image used by these services, leading to their instability and restarts"
  oracle: "False"
